                          Phidget22 for Linux
                             Version 1.17

Installation
============

     ./configure
	 make
	 sudo make install

   This installs the library libphidget22.so and the header phidget22.h.

   *Note: USB devices are by default only usable by root in Linux.
          Install udev script to use Phidgets from a normal 
		  user account (see below).
		  
   *Note: If 'make' fails with 'aclocal-1.14: command not found' or similar:
          This generally happens if the source folder is moved or put under
		  source control - the autoconf files need to be regenerated:
		  
	 apt-get install autoconf automake libtool
	 autoreconf -if
	 ./configure
    
	
Requirements
============

    C compiler and build tools

   These are usually installed by a package called 'build-essential'

	libusb 1.0

   This is generally already installed. The libusb dev files may need to
be installed - this is usually a package called 'libusb-1.0-0-dev'.

	Avahi client library
	
	For Phidget server discovery support, Avahi is required, along with
the Avahi client library. This is usually a package called 
'libavahi-client-dev' or similar.

Options
=======

   Configure options:

   To enable LabVIEW support:
   
     ./configure --enable-labview
     make LABVIEW_CINTOOLS_PATH=/usr/local/natinst/LabVIEW-2010/cintools
	 
   Note: replace 'LabVIEW-2010' with your version

Usage
=====

   Compile your projects with -lphidget22 and include phidget22.h in the
source file.

udev
====

   The udev rules file will make all phidgets world writeable (mode 666)
as soon as they are attached. Note that some systems may already have 
generic USB rulesets defined.  The udev rules are run in order from 
smallest to largest number - the Phidgets rules, at number 99, should 
be high enough so that any USB rules will be overridden.

   To Install:

     cp plat/linux/udev/99-libphidget22.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
