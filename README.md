# RoverFlake - ROS 1 (Noetic)
Our new, ROS 1 Noetic repository. <br>
Make sure to clone reccursively
```git clone https://github.com/UBC-Snowbots/RoverFlake.git --recursive ```
  We are using branches only, you are free to make a fork if you are experienced with git, but using git with 1 remote is going to be easier. We reccommend using gitt CLI if you have experience with it. We reccomend the git GUI from VS code if you havent used git before to pull/push code and manage commits (easiest  to use git CLI to set up repo)
  
```git remote -v``` should return:

```origin	https://github.com/UBC-Snowbots/RoverFlake.git (fetch)```

```origin	https://github.com/UBC-Snowbots/RoverFlake.git (push)```


To run or build any of the ROS code, you will need to set up an ubuntu enviroment. 
  To see how, read the "setup_ubuntu.md" in "resources" (https://github.com/UBC-Snowbots/RoverFlake/blob/fce38688cf4b68fb9d10681cf8c75e355d8a5337/resources/setup_ubuntu.md)
