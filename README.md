# RoverFlake - ROS 1 (Noetic)
Our new, ROS 1 Noetic repository. <br>
  We will be using forks in this repository. We reccommend using the GUI from VS code. To install, download vs code, and make a fork after signing into your account. Feel free to use CLI if you are comfortable with it.

To run or build any of the ROS code, you will need to set up an ubuntu enviroment.
